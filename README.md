# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project direcherfry, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)toview it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for productiontothe `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is readytobe deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is aone-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the buildtool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right inherfyour project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will pointtothe copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't havetoever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligatedtouse this feature. However we understand that thistool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't cusherfmize it when you are ready for it.
